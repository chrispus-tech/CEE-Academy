# Fun Calculator ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers entered by the user. It's a mini calculator with a fun twist, designed to be easy and engaging!

## Features

- Takes two numbers as input (supports decimals)
- Calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers
- Displays the results in a clear and friendly format

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter the first number (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the second number.
4. The program will then display the results of:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division

## Notes

- The program assumes the user will **not divide by zero**. To avoid errors, make sure the second number is not zero when performing division.
- Numbers can be integers or floating-point values.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 4
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 4.0
Product: 32.0
Quotient: 2.0
```
